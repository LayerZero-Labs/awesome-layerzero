## üü¢ Introduction

**LayerZero** is an **omnichain interoperability protocol** that enables seamless communication between different blockchains. It allows developers to build omnichain applications (OApps) that can interact across multiple chains as if they were on a single chain.

**Why build with LayerZero at a hackathon?**

- **Reach More Users:** Deploy your dApp once and interact with users and assets across all supported chains.
- **Unify Liquidity:** Avoid fragmented liquidity; build DEXes, lending platforms, etc., that leverage a shared cross-chain pool.
- **Simplify Development:** Build complex cross-chain logic using familiar tools (Hardhat, Foundry, etc.) and LayerZero's contract standards (OApp, OFT, ONFT). Get started quickly with the `create-lz-oapp` CLI.
- **Enhance Security:** Benefit from a configurable, decentralized security model using Decentralized Verifier Networks (DVNs).
- **Improve User Experience:** Abstract away cross-chain complexities, offering seamless interactions without users needing multiple wallets or bridging steps.
- **Innovate:** Explore novel use cases like cross-chain governance, gaming, data queries (`lzRead`), and complex multi-step workflows (Composability).

## üéØ Hackathon Project Ideas

A few project idea starters, to give you some inspiration.

- **Omnichain Yield Aggregator:** Create a dApp that automatically finds the best yield opportunities for a specific asset (e.g., USDC) across multiple supported chains and allows users to deposit/withdraw from a single interface, using `lzRead` for cross-chain state checks.
- **Cross-Chain NFT Utility Unlocker:** Build an ONFT project where owning the NFT on _any_ supported chain grants access to specific features or content within a dApp deployed on a different chain.
- **Composable DeFi Strategy Builder:** Leverage LayerZero Composability to create a dApp where users can chain together actions across different protocols on multiple chains in a sequence managed by LayerZero messages. For example:
  - Swap on Uniswap (ETH) ‚Üí
  - Bridge Asset via OFT ‚Üí
  - Deposit into Aave (Polygon)
- **Decentralized Cross-Chain Oracle:** Use `lzRead` and potentially `lzMap`/`lzReduce` to build a system where contracts can request aggregated data (e.g., median token price) from multiple chains, providing a more resilient oracle feed.
- **Omnichain Governance Portal:** Design a system where a DAO's governance token (OFT) holders can vote on proposals from any chain where the token exists, with votes securely tallied on a designated home chain via LayerZero messaging.

## üí∞ Prizes & Bounties

[Bounties for ETHGlobal Prague](https://ethglobal.com/events/prague/prizes#layerzero) (the nearest hackathon) are listed below.

#### **lzRead Track - $4000**

- 1st place - $2,500
- 2nd place - $1,500

Develop a comprehensive solution using [LayerZero Read](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/lzread/overview) (`lzRead`) to request, retrieve, and process external on-chain state from destination blockchains.

Your solution should use `lzRead` to perform cross-chain data queries and update state on the source or another destination chain based on the retrieved data.

Projects should focus on secure and efficient cross-chain data queries, using features like `lzMap()` and `lzReduce()` for off-chain computation.

#### Composability Track - $4000

- 1st place - $2,500
- 2nd place - $1,500

Build an innovative application that showcases [LayerZero's horizontal composability](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/composer/overview) features. Your project should break down a complex cross-chain workflow into discrete, sequential steps managed through LayerZero messages.

Demonstrate how you can trigger follow-up actions (composed messages) on a destination chain after an initial LayerZero message is delivered, potentially involving interactions with multiple contracts or protocols across different chains.

Focus on creating advanced, multi-step workflows that wouldn't be easily possible with traditional bridging or single atomic cross-chain transactions. Show how this approach improves user experience, reliability, or enables new use cases by decoupling operations and leveraging LayerZero's message-passing framework.

#### General Prize Track - $2000

- 1st place - $1,000
- 2nd place - $1,000

For outstanding projects utilizing any LayerZero feature (OApp, OFT, ONFT, lzRead, Composability) to build a compelling omnichain application.

This track rewards creative and well-executed projects that demonstrate the power and potential of LayerZero, even if they don't fit perfectly into the specific `lzRead` or Composability tracks. Show us your best omnichain ideas!

## üìã Judging Criteria

- **Innovation & Creativity:** How novel is the idea? Does it leverage LayerZero's unique capabilities in interesting ways?
- **Technical Implementation:** Quality of the code, effective use of LayerZero protocols (OApp, OFT, ONFT, lzRead, Composability), smart contract security, and overall technical soundness.
- **Impact & Usefulness:** How valuable is the application? Does it solve a real-world problem or have significant potential?
- **Omnichain Aspect:** How core is LayerZero to the application? Does it solve a real cross-chain problem or enable a truly omnichain experience?
- **User Experience (UX):** How easy and intuitive is the application to use? Does it successfully abstract away cross-chain complexity?
- **Presentation & Demo:** Clarity of the project presentation and effectiveness of the live demo.
